  <h1>FAMILY</h1>
  
  <p>Family is the place where you learn your first lesson in life. Your family members are the only assets that will remain with you      forever. Whatever the circumstances, family members are always there for each other to support us. Good values and good morals are always taught in a family.

	In the family, we are prepared to respect our elders and love younger ones. We learn lessons consistently from our family, about honesty, dependability, kindness and so on. Although I am a student in my final year, my family always treats me like a child but always provides me with a sensation of so much love and care.
